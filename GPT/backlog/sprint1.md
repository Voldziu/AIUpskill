## US001: Enable user profile editing

### User Story
As a registered user, I want to edit my profile information so that I can keep my details up to date.

### Business Value
Allows users to maintain accurate and current information, improving user satisfaction and data integrity.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am logged into my account, when I navigate to the profile page, then I should see an 'Edit Profile' button.
2. Given I click the 'Edit Profile' button, when I modify my information and click 'Save', then my updated details should be stored and displayed.
3. Given I enter invalid data (e.g., wrong email format), when I click 'Save', then I should see an error message indicating the issue.

### INVEST Validation
- **Independent:** This story is independent because it focuses solely on profile editing and does not depend on other features.
- **Negotiable:** The fields available for editing and the error handling specifics can be refined based on team discussions.
- **Valuable:** Provides value by empowering users to manage their own data, reducing administrative overhead.
- **Estimable:** The scope is clear and bounded, enabling the team to estimate effort accurately.
- **Small:** This story is limited to editing functionality and can be completed in a single sprint.
- **Testable:** Acceptance criteria define clear scenarios for testing, ensuring the functionality is verifiable.

### Story Points

## US002: Implement backend API for retrieving user transactions

### User Story
As a system administrator, I want an API endpoint to retrieve user transactions so that I can analyze user activity.

### Business Value
Enables data analysis and insights into user behavior, which can inform business decisions and improve services.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given the API receives a valid user ID, when a GET request is sent to the endpoint, then it should return a list of transactions for that user in JSON format.
2. Given the API receives an invalid or non-existent user ID, when a GET request is sent, then it should return a 404 error with a meaningful error message.
3. Given the API is queried with optional parameters (e.g., date range), when a GET request is sent, then it should filter the transactions accordingly.

### INVEST Validation
- **Independent:** This story focuses on a single API endpoint and does not depend on other backend functionality.
- **Negotiable:** Query parameters, response format, and error messages can be discussed and refined as needed.
- **Valuable:** Provides business value by enabling administrators to gain insights into user activity and improve decision-making.
- **Estimable:** The requirements are clear and granular, making effort estimation straightforward.
- **Small:** The scope is confined to creating one API endpoint, which can be completed within a sprint.
- **Testable:** Acceptance criteria define test cases for valid inputs, invalid inputs, and filters.

### Story Points

## US003: Add search functionality to the product catalog

### User Story
As a shopper, I want to search for products by name or category so that I can find items more easily.

### Business Value
Improves user experience by enabling efficient navigation of the product catalog, potentially increasing sales.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am on the product catalog page, when I enter a product name into the search bar and press 'Search', then the results should display products matching the name.
2. Given I am on the product catalog page, when I select a category from the dropdown and press 'Search', then the results should display products within that category.
3. Given there are no products matching my search criteria, when I perform a search, then I should see a 'No results found' message.

### INVEST Validation
- **Independent:** This story is independent as it focuses only on adding search functionality to the catalog.
- **Negotiable:** Search parameters, UI design, and error messaging can be refined based on team input.
- **Valuable:** Enhances user experience and increases the likelihood of finding desired products, boosting engagement and potential sales.
- **Estimable:** The requirements are straightforward, allowing the team to estimate development effort effectively.
- **Small:** The scope is limited to search functionality in the catalog, making it achievable in one sprint.
- **Testable:** Acceptance criteria define clear scenarios for testing search behavior and edge cases.

### Story Points
*To be estimated by the development team during planning poker*

### Priority
*To be determined by Product Owner*
